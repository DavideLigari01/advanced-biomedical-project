The architectures of the models used in the experiments are detailed in Table \ref{tab:models}.
Special attention is given to the ensemble models, which combine predictions from multiple models
to enhance overall performance.\\
\noindent
All MLP\_Ensemble models consist of the individual models listed in their architecture name.
These models’ predictions are combined using a soft voting strategy, where the final prediction is
determined by the argmax of the sum of the predicted probabilities from each model. This approach is
effective when the models are well-calibrated and exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses.\\
\noindent
The ALL\_Ensemble model aggregates the predictions of all individual models using a majority vote strategy.
In contrast, the CB\_ALL\_Ensemble model also considers all individual models but uses a CatBoost model to
aggregate the predictions. This allows for a more flexible voting strategy, potentially leading to improved
performance.
